# WebRTC Live Streaming Implementation

This document describes the alternative live streaming functionality using WebRTC technology, which provides real-time, low-latency streaming directly in the browser without requiring external streaming servers.

## üöÄ Features

### WebRTC Live Streaming

- **Real-time streaming**: Ultra-low latency (100-500ms) compared to traditional RTMP/HLS
- **Peer-to-peer connections**: Direct browser-to-browser communication
- **No external servers**: No need for RTMP servers or CDN infrastructure
- **Built-in chat**: Real-time chat functionality during streams
- **Room-based system**: Unique rooms for each stream session
- **Viewer management**: Track and display viewer counts
- **Private streams**: Option to create private streaming rooms

### Technical Advantages

- **Lower latency**: WebRTC provides near-instantaneous streaming
- **Better quality**: Direct peer connections maintain video quality
- **Scalability**: Each viewer connects directly to the broadcaster
- **Cost-effective**: No server infrastructure costs for streaming
- **Cross-platform**: Works on all modern browsers and devices

## üé• Usage Guide

### For Broadcasters

1. **Create a Stream Room**

   - Navigate to the WebRTC Live Streaming page
   - Enter stream title and description
   - Choose if the stream should be private
   - Click "Create Stream Room"

2. **Start Broadcasting**

   - Allow camera and microphone permissions
   - Your local video will appear in the preview
   - Viewers can now join your stream

3. **Manage Your Stream**
   - Monitor viewer count in real-time
   - Use the chat feature to interact with viewers
   - Click "Stop Broadcasting" when finished

### For Viewers

1. **Browse Active Streams**

   - View the list of available live streams
   - See stream title, broadcaster, and viewer count

2. **Join a Stream**

   - Click "Join Stream" on any active stream
   - The broadcaster's video will appear
   - Use chat to interact with the broadcaster and other viewers

3. **Leave Stream**
   - Click "Leave Stream" to exit
   - You can join other streams or create your own

## üîå WebRTC Signaling Events

### Client to Server Events

- `join-room`: Join a streaming room
- `offer`: Send WebRTC offer to viewer
- `answer`: Send WebRTC answer to broadcaster
- `ice-candidate`: Send ICE candidate
- `request-stream`: Request stream from broadcaster
- `stream-started`: Notify stream has started
- `stream-stopped`: Notify stream has stopped
- `chat-message`: Send chat message

### Server to Client Events

- `room-joined`: Confirm room join
- `viewer-joined`: New viewer joined
- `viewer-left`: Viewer left the room
- `viewer-request-stream`: Viewer requesting stream
- `offer`: Receive WebRTC offer
- `answer`: Receive WebRTC answer

## üéØ Key Features Explained

### Room Management

- Each stream gets a unique room ID (UUID)
- Rooms are created when a broadcaster starts streaming
- Rooms are automatically cleaned up when empty

### Peer Connections

- WebRTC peer connections are established between broadcaster and each viewer
- STUN servers help with NAT traversal
- ICE candidates are exchanged for optimal connection paths

### Chat System

- Real-time chat using Socket.IO
- Messages are broadcast to all users in the room
- Username and timestamp included with each message

### Viewer Tracking

- Real-time viewer count updates
- Notifications when viewers join/leave
- Automatic cleanup when viewers disconnect

## üîí Security Considerations

### Authentication

- All stream creation requires valid JWT token
- Users can only manage their own streams
- Private streams are supported

### Room Security

- Room IDs are UUIDs (practically unguessable)
- No authentication required to join public streams
- Private streams can be implemented with additional security

### Media Permissions

- Browser handles camera/microphone permissions
- Users must explicitly grant access
- Streams stop if permissions are revoked

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Connection Management

- Automatic cleanup of disconnected peers
- Efficient room management
- Memory leak prevention

### Video Quality

- WebRTC automatically adapts to network conditions
- Multiple quality levels supported
- Bandwidth optimization

### Scalability

- Each viewer connects directly to broadcaster
- No server bottleneck for video streaming
- Signaling server only handles coordination

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera/Microphone Not Working**

   - Check browser permissions
   - Ensure HTTPS is used (required for getUserMedia)
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Connection Issues**

   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure STUN servers are accessible
   - Try different network (mobile vs WiFi)

3. **Stream Not Starting**

   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify WebRTC support in browser
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed

4. **Chat Not Working**
   - Check Socket.IO connection
   - Verify server is running
   - Check network connectivity

### Browser Support

- Chrome 56+
- Firefox 52+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+
